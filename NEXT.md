1. There may be a case where battery level of closest bot may not be enough to tranport package to destination.
    - One option would be to have the initial bot carry the package to a point where it had enough batterlevel to return to its charging port and have another
      bot pickup where it left off.
    - Another better option is to get a bot that is closest AND have enough battery level to deliver package.

2. Database needs to be updated with new positions and battery levels.
